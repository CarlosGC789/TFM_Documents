# TFM_Documents
This repository contains an R script called Data_construction where the construction of the databases
is detailed, an RMarkdown called TFM_R where all the code done in the work is placed, a folder called
DATASETS where the annual, monthly, daily and hourly databases are in .txt format; and a folder called
EXCELS where all the Excels extracted both from the Python functions and from the different web pages for
the construction of these databases are located.
